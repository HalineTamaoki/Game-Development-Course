# Detona Farm

This project was part of DIO (Digital Innovation One) code challenge. The challenge was to build a game based on Detona Ralph with pure HTML, CSS and Javascript.<br>

To do this, I've adapted the project to a farm context. The final game was like the gif below:<br>

## Running

Run the application withÂ `http-server ./`Â command. 

```shell
http-server ./
```

Ps: to run the project you must have the http-server npm installed. To do this, just run npm install http-server.

Hope you like ðŸ˜ƒ
